    <!--For the audio element and scoreboard element, we could have added them progromatically with javascript. The reason I chose to do it like this
    is because we are using a prebuild game engine that is drawing the canvas on the screen. For this project I did not want to alter the engine.js file,
    and thought it would make more sense to declare it here.-->
